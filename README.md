Autocallable products, also known as autocallable notes or autocallable structured products, are complex financial instruments that combine elements of bonds and derivatives. They are primarily used to enhance yield, typically in a low-interest-rate environment, and are structured to pay out a coupon or potentially return the principal based on the performance of an underlying asset, which could be a stock, an index, or a basket of assets.

### **How Autocallables Work**

Autocallables usually have the following structure:

1. **Underlying Asset:** The performance of the autocallable is linked to an underlying asset, such as a single stock, a stock index, or a basket of stocks.

2. **Coupon Payments:** These notes typically offer periodic coupon payments, which can be contingent on the performance of the underlying asset. If certain conditions are met, the investor receives the coupon.

3. **Autocall Feature:** Autocallables include an autocall (automatic call) feature that triggers an early redemption of the note if the underlying asset reaches or exceeds a specified level (called the "autocall level") on a predetermined observation date. If this happens, the investor receives the principal plus the final coupon payment, and the note is terminated early.

4. **Barrier Levels:** Many autocallables have a barrier level, which is a critical component determining the payout. If the underlying asset drops below this barrier at maturity, the investor might suffer a loss of principal.

5. **Maturity:** If the autocall event has not been triggered, the product will reach maturity. Depending on the performance of the underlying asset at maturity, the investor may receive back the full principal, a reduced principal, or the underlying asset itself.

### **Variants of Autocallables**

There are several variants of autocallables, each with unique features:

1. **Express Certificates:**
   - **Standard Express Certificates:** These typically offer high coupon payments and an autocall feature. If the underlying asset's price is above the autocall level on an observation date, the product is called, and the investor receives the coupon and principal.
   - **Express Memory Certificates:** These offer a "memory" feature, which means that if a coupon payment is missed because the autocall level was not reached, it can be paid retrospectively if the underlying asset exceeds the autocall level on a subsequent observation date.

2. **Relax Certificates:**
   - These are similar to express certificates but with a lower barrier for protection. The "relax" feature usually refers to a more forgiving structure where the investor is more likely to receive the coupon or maintain principal protection.

3. **Airbag Feature:**
   - The airbag feature provides additional protection to the investor by cushioning the impact of the underlying asset dropping below the barrier level. For example, if the asset drops below the barrier but remains above a secondary lower level (the "airbag" level), the investor may still receive their principal or a reduced loss instead of a complete loss. This feature mitigates the downside risk in adverse market conditions.

### **Structure and Components**

Autocallables are composed of several financial components:

1. **Zero-Coupon Bond:** The core of an autocallable is often a zero-coupon bond, which ensures the return of principal if certain conditions are met. The bond component provides the base level of principal protection.

2. **Option Components:** 
   - **Call Options:** These are embedded within the autocall structure to generate the autocall feature. If the underlying asset performs well, the call options provide the returns to the investor.
   - **Put Options or Barrier Options:** These options might be included to provide the downside protection (barrier or airbag feature). They influence the payoff depending on the assetâ€™s performance relative to the barrier level.

### **Behavior in Different Market Environments**

- **Bull Market:** In a rising market, autocallables often perform well, with the underlying asset reaching or exceeding the autocall level, leading to early redemption and a return of principal with coupon payments.

- **Sideways Market:** If the market is flat, the autocall might not be triggered, but investors could still receive periodic coupons. At maturity, if the asset is above the barrier level, the principal is returned.

- **Bear Market:** In a declining market, if the underlying asset falls below the barrier, the investor could face significant losses, depending on the structure. However, features like the airbag might mitigate these losses to some extent.

### **Summary of Key Differences**

- **Express vs. Memory Express:** The memory express adds the potential for missed coupons to be paid later if conditions improve, whereas standard express certificates do not have this feature.

- **Relax Feature:** This provides a lower barrier for more robust protection compared to standard autocallables.

- **Airbag Feature:** This adds an additional layer of protection by reducing potential losses even if the barrier is breached.

Each of these features adds complexity and may influence the overall risk-return profile of the autocallable, making them suitable for different market views and risk appetites. Investors need to carefully assess these structures to match their expectations with potential market outcomes.
