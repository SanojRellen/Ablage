Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of sustainability standards besides the EU Green Bond Standard:

1. **ICMA Green Bond Principles (GBP)**: These provide a voluntary framework for issuing green bonds. They outline four core components:  
   - **Use of Proceeds**: Funds must be used for green projects.
   - **Process for Project Evaluation and Selection**: Issuers should describe how projects are selected and evaluated for environmental benefits.
   - **Management of Proceeds**: Proceeds should be tracked and allocated to green projects.
   - **Reporting**: Issuers should provide regular updates on the use of proceeds and environmental impact.

2. **Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI)**: The CBI offers certification for bonds that meet criteria aligned with a low-carbon economy. This includes:  
   - **Sector-Specific Standards**: CBI focuses on several sectors, such as energy, transport, and buildings, ensuring that projects contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
   - **Third-Party Verification**: Independent auditors must confirm compliance with CBI standards for certification.

3. **Sustainability Bond Guidelines (SBG)**: Issued by ICMA, these guidelines apply to bonds that finance both green and social projects. The focus is on:  
   - **Use of Proceeds**: Must finance projects with clear environmental or social benefits.
   - **Transparency and Accountability**: Issuers are encouraged to provide impact metrics and updates on fund usage.

4. **Social Bond Principles (SBP)**: Also from ICMA, these principles provide guidelines for bonds financing social projects, similar to the Green Bond Principles but with a focus on positive social impacts (e.g., affordable housing, healthcare).

5. **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**: Some bonds align with specific SDGs, especially for issuers focusing on broader sustainability outcomes, like poverty alleviation or gender equality.

These frameworks and initiatives promote transparency, accountability, and integrity in the sustainable finance market.
